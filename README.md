# 🧠 Reasoning Vault

> A personal archive of algorithmic decision-making, heuristics, and strategy patterns — built for clarity, not code.

## 📌 What This Is

This project is a **structured knowledge base** that captures how I think through algorithmic problems — not just how to solve them.

Rather than focusing on raw code or platform solutions, this vault documents:

- 🧩 Problem breakdowns in my own words
- 🚧 Naive strategies and where they fail
- ✅ Optimal strategies and key insights
- 🧠 Heuristics used in real-time decision-making
- ⚠️ Common traps and false starts
- 🧭 Meta-patterns that reappear across problems

It's part of a broader effort to **externalize reasoning**, build reusable mental models, and eventually train intelligent agents to think with context — not just syntax.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Most tutorials focus on *what* to do.  
This vault focuses on *how* and *why* certain decisions are made — especially when:

- Multiple solutions exist
- Tradeoffs between speed, memory, and simplicity emerge
- Failure paths reveal deeper understanding
- You want to teach AI how humans actually reason

---

## 📁 Structure

Problems are organized by source:

```
/problems/
├── leetcode/
├── hackerrank/
├── geeksforgeeks/
├── advent-of-code/
```


Each file is a standalone markdown document using a consistent format with metadata, rephrased summaries, strategy notes, and general insights.

Example: problems/leetcode/001-two-sum.md

## ⚖️ Legal Note

- No LeetCode, HackerRank, or GfG content has been copied or redistributed.
- All summaries, insights, and heuristics are written originally based on problem-solving experience or public domain understanding.
- This vault is about **reasoning**, not solution sharing.

---

## 🧪 Future Vision

This project may evolve into:

- A dataset for AI training or fine-tuning
- A searchable, taggable reference for engineers
- A framework for teaching decision-making over syntax
- An open-source mental model index for real-world problem solving
