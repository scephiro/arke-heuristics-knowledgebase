## 🧩 Problem Summary 

Clearly and briefly describe what the problem *really* wants, as if explaining to yourself or your AI assistant.

## 🚧 Initial Approach

What is the first obvious or brute-force method you’d try?  
Where does it break down? Highlight weaknesses or inefficiencies.

## ✅ Optimal Strategy

What is the ideal approach? Why is it better?  
Include key logic steps, optimizations, or structural changes.

## 🧠 Heuristics & Insights

Bullet-point style list of decision patterns or shortcuts:
- "If array is unsorted but index matters → use hash map"
- "If there’s only one valid solution → think early exit"

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

List of traps, misunderstandings, or implementation bugs commonly seen.

## 🧭 Meta Insight

Generalized or transferable patterns. What does this teach beyond the specific problem?  
(E.g. “This is a greedy decision disguised as a loop problem.”)

## 🗃️ Notes

Optional: Why you picked this problem, what you noticed, or how it relates to a larger system of thinking.
