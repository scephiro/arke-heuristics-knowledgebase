## üß© Problem Summary

Reimplement the classic Mario half-pyramid from CS50, but using Python.

Given a user input height `n` (between 1 and 8), print a right-aligned pyramid of hashes (`#`) of height `n`.

Example for `n = 4`:
```
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```

---

## üîÑ Initial Approach

- Prompt user for height between 1 and 8
- Use a `for` loop to iterate over each row
- For each row:
  - Print spaces (`" "`) to right-align the pyramid
  - Print hashes (`"#"`) for the current row count

Example logic:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(" " * (n - i) + "#" * i)
```

## ‚úÖ Optimal Strategy

The initial approach is already simple and efficient.

Tips:
- Use string multiplication for cleaner code  
- Validate user input before proceeding  
- Use built-in `input()` and `int()` conversion carefully to avoid exceptions

---

## üß† Heuristics & Insights

- Python string multiplication (`" " * count`) is a powerful tool for text patterns  
- Loop ranges in Python are exclusive on the upper bound ‚Äî `range(1, n+1)` includes `n`  
- Breaking problems into smaller parts (spaces, hashes) simplifies logic  
- Input validation is crucial to avoid runtime errors

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- Off-by-one errors in loops  
- Forgetting to convert input strings to integers  
- Using `print` incorrectly (missing commas or concatenation)  
- Ignoring input constraints (height must be between 1 and 8)

---

## üß≠ Meta Insight

This problem demonstrates Python‚Äôs elegance for text-based algorithms, emphasizing readable, concise code for classic exercises.

It‚Äôs a bridge from manual loops to idiomatic Python constructs.
