# Week 6 – Python

**Focus:** Transitioning from C to Python — embracing higher-level syntax, abstraction, and built-in functionality.

This week covers:
- Translating concepts from C (loops, conditionals, functions) into Python
- Using Python's dynamic typing and expressive syntax
- Writing concise, readable, and powerful code using Pythonic idioms

## 🧠 Heuristics to Extract

- **Simplicity first**: Python is designed for clarity — leverage that to make your code readable
- Python handles memory, string management, and data structures for you — shift your mental model away from manual control
- Use built-in functions (e.g. `sum()`, `round()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`) to avoid unnecessary loops
- Use list comprehensions and slicing where appropriate — these are idiomatic and efficient
- Lean into Python’s strengths: dynamic typing, first-class functions, standard library power

This week is about *translating logic, not syntax*. The goal is to think in Python, not write C with different punctuation.

## 📂 Problems Covered

- `001-hello-python.md`: Basic syntax, variables, and printing — "Hello, World" the Pythonic way  
- `002-mario-python.md`: Recreate the Mario pyramid using Python’s loops and string multiplication  
- `003-readability-python.md`: Port the readability score calculator using Python's string and math capabilities

## 🗃️ Notes

This week is less about solving new problems and more about **rewiring your problem-solving approach** to fit Python’s model of abstraction and expressiveness.

You’re still solving the same logic — just with a sharper, more elegant blade.
