# Week 3 – Voting Algorithms

**Focus:** Introduction to algorithms that simulate real-world voting systems, focusing on data structures, preference aggregation, and decision logic.

This week covers:
- Implementing voting systems like Plurality and Tideman
- Understanding linked data and graph concepts
- Handling user input to simulate elections and preferences
- Applying logical rules to resolve conflicts and rank candidates

## 🧠 Heuristics to Extract

- Representing preferences and votes as arrays or matrices  
- Processing pairwise comparisons and ranking mechanisms  
- Detecting cycles and handling tie-breakers in graphs  
- Separating data input, processing, and output phases  

These skills connect to broader topics like graph theory, sorting algorithms, and real-world system modeling.

## 📂 Problems Covered

- `001-plurality.md`: Implement a simple plurality voting system that counts votes and declares the winner.  
- `002-tideman.md`: Implement the Tideman (ranked pairs) voting system, managing preferences and locking in pairs without creating cycles.

## 🗃️ Notes

Week 3 bridges basic algorithmic thinking and more complex data representations. It emphasizes:

- Modeling real-world problems computationally  
- Working with advanced data structures (graphs, adjacency matrices)  
- Algorithmic problem decomposition
