status: "complete"

## üß© Problem Summary

Build a Flask web app that lets users:

- Register and log in securely
- Look up real-time stock quotes via API
- Buy and sell stocks with balance tracking
- View transaction history
- See portfolio overview with current prices

The app must manage user sessions, database state, real-time updates, and error handling ‚Äî all via Flask and SQLite.

---

## üîÑ Initial Approach

- Set up project structure (`app.py`, `templates/`, `static/`, `helpers.py`)  
- Implement user registration/login with password hashing  
- Connect to external stock API for real-time prices  
- Track transactions and balances using SQLite  
- Render portfolio via Jinja templates

---

## ‚úÖ Optimal Strategy

- Modularize helpers (API access, price formatting, validation) in `helpers.py`  
- Use sessions for login state; don‚Äôt rely on URL-based auth  
- Always validate and sanitize form inputs (both client and server-side)  
- Make use of CS50‚Äôs `check50` test cases to verify logic and edge cases  
- Use database **transactions** or atomic logic to avoid race conditions (e.g. double purchases)

---

## üß† Heuristics & Insights

- **Treat web routes like logic gates** ‚Äî each path has clear preconditions and side effects  
- Sessions allow state without bloated URLs or hidden fields  
- Templating requires careful separation of logic (`app.py`) and layout (`.html`)  
- **Guard every decision with validation**: funds, stock symbol, share quantity  
- Use decorators or helper functions for repeated checks (e.g. login_required)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- Updating portfolio without reflecting live prices  
- Failing to handle float rounding errors in currency (use `decimal.Decimal`)  
- Incomplete input checks (e.g. negative shares, invalid symbols)  
- Forgetting to hash passwords (security flaw!)  
- Mishandling SQLite constraints or schema changes

---

## üß≠ Meta Insight

This is where web dev gets *real* ‚Äî you‚Äôre not just coding, you're **managing users, money, and live data**.

You learn to:
- Control app state across requests
- Combine UI, logic, and storage seamlessly
- Think in user stories, not just functions

This is a **foundational problem** for future full-stack apps, product dashboards, and AI-enhanced interfaces.
