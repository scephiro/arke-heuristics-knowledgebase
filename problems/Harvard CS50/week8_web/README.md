# Week 8 – Web

**Focus:** Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the foundational technologies of web development.

This week is about learning to:
- Structure content using **HTML**
- Style and lay out pages using **CSS**
- Add interactivity and behavior using **JavaScript**

You’ll also explore basic web concepts like the **DOM**, **event handling**, and **developer tools**.

## 🧠 Heuristics to Extract

- Web development is **separation of concerns**: structure (HTML), style (CSS), behavior (JS)  
- Think **in components**: small, self-contained chunks of content or logic  
- The DOM is a **live, dynamic tree** — changes affect what the user sees in real time  
- JavaScript’s event system is **asynchronous** — behavior is often driven by user interaction  
- CSS is **cascading and inherited** — specificity and selector strategy matter  
- In web dev, **what’s visible** is only part of the logic — inspect, trace, and debug hidden states

## 🔬 Deep-Dive Relevance

### 🤖 AI / Assistant Applications
- Many AI assistants interface with or render HTML — understanding DOM structure enables smarter UI manipulation
- Building intelligent **low-code or no-code tools** starts with mastering web primitives
- JavaScript forms the baseline for **client-side automation**, like smart agents that respond to user actions

### 🧱 Enterprise Use
- Robust UI architecture relies on understanding **component state, DOM lifecycles, and responsive design**
- Clean, semantic HTML is essential for **accessibility, SEO, and internationalization**
- JavaScript event models and async programming patterns influence app **resilience and user experience**

### 🛠️ Automation & Heuristic Insights
- Dynamic DOM manipulation is key for **web scraping, testing bots, and browser automation tools** (e.g. Puppeteer, Selenium)
- CSS debugging is a **visual reasoning task** — AI tools that style or fix UI must understand layout principles

## 📂 Problems Covered

- `001-homepage.md`: Build a personal homepage with structure, style, and simple JS behavior.

> Note: This problem is more project-like than algorithmic. Heuristics here are about **design decisions**, **UI strategy**, and **maintainability**.

## 🗃️ Notes

Web is where code **meets people**. It’s not about efficiency — it’s about **experience, clarity, and interaction**.

The real challenge is not writing HTML/CSS/JS — it’s thinking in **systems that evolve with user needs and constraints**.
