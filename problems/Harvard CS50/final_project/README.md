# Final Project – Capstone

**Focus:** Build something of your own using the tools and concepts you've learned — no constraints, no scaffolding.

This project is:
- **Open-ended**: You choose what to build.
- **Full-stack**: Expected to involve front-end, back-end, and/or database work.
- **Real-world**: You’re expected to deploy or demonstrate it.

---

## 🧠 Heuristics to Extract

- **Start with a problem, not a feature** — what pain point are you solving?  
- Focus on **clarity of architecture**: how components connect, not just what they do  
- Prioritize **MVP scope** — solve one thing well before expanding  
- Expect to learn new tech while applying old concepts  
- Debugging real projects means debugging *your assumptions*, not just code

## 🔬 Deep-Dive Relevance

### 🤖 AI / Assistant Applications
- Projects like this reveal what’s **missing from pre-trained AI** — decision-making, scope reasoning, trade-offs  
- Excellent training ground for AI that learns from or supports human developers  
- Helps AI see how small, modular concepts combine into systems

### 🧱 Enterprise Use
- Final projects simulate **product thinking**: user goals, system constraints, deployment  
- Exposes real challenges like auth, edge cases, fail states, UX trade-offs  
- Great data for testing AI copilots in **code review, architecture suggestion, or debugging**

## 🗃️ Notes

The final project isn’t about tech mastery — it’s about **initiative** and **systemic thinking**.

Most real-world engineering doesn’t come with specs — this is your chance to think, design, build, test, and ship.

> Optional: You can add a `project-summary.md` here if you want to break down your own final project heuristically.
