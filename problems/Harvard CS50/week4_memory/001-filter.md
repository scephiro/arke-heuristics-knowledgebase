## üß© Problem Summary

You‚Äôre given a 2D image represented as a grid of pixels (`RGBTRIPLE`s), and you need to apply various filters by modifying the pixel data in place.

Tasks:
- Convert the image to **grayscale**
- Apply a **sepia** tone
- **Reflect** the image horizontally
- **Blur** the image using a simple box blur algorithm

Each pixel is made of red, green, and blue values (0‚Äì255), and the image is stored as a 2D array of structs.

---

## üîÑ Initial Approach

- Loop through every pixel in the image
- For grayscale: average the R, G, B values
- For sepia: apply a weighted sum for each color channel
- For reflect: swap pixels across the midpoint of each row
- For blur:
  - Copy the image to a temporary buffer
  - For each pixel, average all valid neighboring pixels

This approach uses nested loops and simple arithmetic, making it accessible but prone to subtle bugs if not careful.

---

## ‚úÖ Optimal Strategy

This problem is less about speed and more about **correctness and boundary handling**.

Best practices include:
- Avoid modifying the image while reading from it (especially for blur)
- Use helper functions to cleanly separate each filter
- For blur: use a temporary copy so pixel changes don‚Äôt affect subsequent calculations
- Carefully handle edge pixels when averaging neighbors (avoid going out of bounds)

---

## üß† Heuristics & Insights

- When dealing with **matrix transformations**, always check if changes to one cell could affect others
- For **image processing**, copying before writing is often safer
- Reflecting requires careful **index mirroring**: `image[i][width - j - 1]`
- Sepia calculations may exceed 255 ‚Äî **clamp** values to the valid range
- Convert floats back to integers carefully (rounding vs truncating)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- Accidentally modifying the image in place while reading from it (especially during blur)  
- Failing to clamp values between 0 and 255 for sepia  
- Forgetting that division of integers can lead to truncation  
- Swapping pixels incorrectly when reflecting ‚Äî especially off-by-one errors  
- Not properly averaging neighboring pixels for blur ‚Äî especially at the borders

## üß≠ Meta Insight

This is your first hands-on with **low-level memory manipulation** for a structured data type (`RGBTRIPLE`). It mirrors real-world tasks in:
- Game engines
- Camera filters
- Low-level graphics rendering

You‚Äôre learning to treat arrays as memory blocks, with precision and respect for edge cases.

## üóÉÔ∏è Notes

- This is a gentle but deep intro to **spatial algorithms** and **buffered memory manipulation**
- Every mistake here is the kind that causes real bugs in production systems ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth doing right
