# Week 0 – Scratch

**Focus:** Intro to logic, sequences, conditions, loops, and basic computational thinking — using a visual programming environment.

This week is a warm-up designed to introduce non-programmers to core ideas in programming using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a block-based coding platform.

## 🧠 Heuristics to Extract

Although there are no `.md` problem files this week, Week 0 lays the foundation for:

- Understanding **sequential execution**
- Designing **conditional logic flows**
- Using **loops** and **event triggers**
- Thinking in terms of **inputs, outputs, and state**
- Translating human logic into step-by-step procedures

These are essential mental models that translate directly into real code later (especially C, Python, and algorithms).

## 🧩 Example Projects

> Note: These are not written as `.md` files here, but you can optionally reflect on them in a separate `scratch-projects/` section if needed.

- **"Say Hello" Logic**
- **"Click to Animate"**
- **"Keep Score" mini-games**
- **Maze navigators, simple counters, sprite chasers, etc.**

## 🗃️ Notes

Scratch is visual, but the **logic patterns** are real. You can already start spotting:

- Naive vs optimized logic (e.g. duplicate blocks vs loops)
- Reusable blocks (i.e., early functions)
- Event-driven behavior (an early look at reactive programming)
