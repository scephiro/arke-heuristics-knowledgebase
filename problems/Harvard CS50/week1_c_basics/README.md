# Week 1 – C Basics

**Focus:** Core programming fundamentals in C — variables, conditionals, loops, and functions — introduced through real coding problems.

This week emphasizes:
- Mastering C syntax and compiling basics
- Control flow with loops and conditionals
- Input validation and error handling
- Algorithmic thinking via pattern building and checksum validation

## 🧠 Heuristics to Extract

Key lessons this week include:
- Structuring nested loops for geometric output
- Applying arithmetic and modulus operations for digit extraction
- Differentiating naive versus optimized approaches to problem-solving
- Breaking down problems into validation and classification steps

## 📂 Problems Covered

- `001-mario.md`: Building a right-aligned pyramid using nested loops and character alignment.
- `002-credit.md`: Implementing Luhn’s Algorithm to validate credit cards and classifying card types by prefix and length.

## 🗃️ Notes

Week 1 is a transition from conceptual programming to concrete problem-solving.

It sets the tone for:
- Procedural logic  
- Precise control of data flow  
- Separation of concerns (validation vs classification)

These form the foundation for all future CS50 problem sets.
