# Week 7 ‚Äì SQL

**Focus:** Working with relational databases using SQL for querying, filtering, and joining data.

This week introduces:
- Writing SQL statements (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`)
- Understanding relational models (tables, primary keys, foreign keys)
- Extracting insights from structured data
- Applying basic data analysis techniques using SQL

## üß† Heuristics to Extract

- SQL is about **asking the right question** ‚Äî clarity of query reflects clarity of thought  
- Use filtering (`WHERE`) before sorting (`ORDER BY`) for cleaner logic  
- Always alias your tables for clarity in multi-joins  
- Normalize tables to avoid redundancy, but denormalize carefully for read performance  
- Use joins when thinking in **relationships**, not rows

## üìÇ Problems Covered

## üóÉÔ∏è Notes

SQL may feel rigid at first, but it forces precision in thinking and rewards you with powerful insights from even simple datasets.

It also serves as a **lingua franca** for data access across almost all major systems ‚Äî AI pipelines, backend services, analytics dashboards, and more.
