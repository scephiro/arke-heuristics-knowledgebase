# ⚙️ Ideas for Automation

This is a foundation for machines to learn structured reasoning.  
Here’s a running list of automation ideas that can be layered over time.

---

## ✅ 1. Frontmatter Parser

- Script that extracts metadata (`---`) into a searchable JSON database
- Allows local search, tagging, filtering by tag, difficulty, source

---

## 🤖 2. AI Agent: Heuristic Coach

- Custom GPT or Cursor agent that:
  - Summarizes decision paths
  - Finds similar problems by structure
  - Diagnoses poor strategy from raw input

---

## 📊 3. Local Retrieval-Augmented Search (RAG)

- Vector-embed all `.md` files using OpenAI embeddings
- Serve through a local RAG pipeline to answer:
  > “What problems require early exit strategies?”
  > “Show me greedy vs. DP tradeoffs in medium problems”

---

## 🧠 4. Meta-Heuristic Miner

- Run NLP over all files to extract common decision flows
- Generate meta-insights like:
  - "Most hash map problems involve single-pass iteration"
  - "Sliding window appears in 75% of string optimization problems"

---

## 🔁 5. File Bootstrapper

- CLI or GPT-powered agent that creates a new `.md` file with frontmatter and empty sections
- Automatically names and numbers problems
- Pulls source data (title, tags) from user input

---

## 🧪 6. Fine-Tuning Dataset Extractor

- Output files in a format suitable for fine-tuning
- E.g. JSON format of:
  - Prompt: “How would you solve a problem where…”
  - Response: Full strategy reasoning

---

## 🔄 7. Repo-to-Blog Converter

- Script that turns `.md` files into formatted blog posts
- Supports export to:
  - Dev.to
  - Medium
  - Personal site
  - LinkedIn snippets

---

## 💡 Experimental

- Semantic versioning of strategies
- AI that challenges naive solutions with counterexamples
- “Reasoning diff” tool to show how one problem differs from another
